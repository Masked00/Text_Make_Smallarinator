 Have you experienced this before? Who is right and who is wrong? Neither. It was at that point their biggest breakthrough came. Perhaps all those years of perseverance finally paid off. It must come from within you. Where are you settling in your life right now? Could you be you playing for bigger stakes than you are? The smell of antiseptic solution. A contentment. Calm and painless. We were no longer squealing or giggling. She watched me watching her. So become intentional on what you want out of life. Commit to it. Nurture your dreams.
